# Classic-API-Swagger-Specification

This swagger specification enhances Jamf Pro's built-in documentation for the Classic API by including object definitions, examples and responses. This documentation is maintained outside of the Jamf Pro code base and therefore is liable to include inaccuracies, especially as new versions of Jamf Pro are released. Please open pull requests or create issues for any innacuracies that you identify, noting the version of Jamf Pro you're testing against.
